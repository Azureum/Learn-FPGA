# FPGA Projects

## Description
This is where I'll be displaying all my project / things I'm doing in order to build a better foundation with FPGA's! If you would like to use any of this code or have suggestions feel free to reach out! These ideas were generated with the help of ChatGPT as I have no idea where to start! NONE OF THIS CODE IS WRITTEN BY IT, that ruins the point of learning and gaining wrinkles! This will also be done in conjunction with my other project of building my own CPU from the ground up, if you want to check it out click [here](https://github.com/Azureum/MPU) or go to my repos!

## Tools
The current FPGA I am using is the Nexys Video Artix-7 FPGA, which has the Xilinx Artix¬Æ-7 XC7A200T and a bunch of other features! You can purchase it here: [here](https://digilent.com/shop/nexys-video-artix-7-fpga-trainer-board-for-multimedia-applications/).

I also have a Seven Segment Display PMOD from Digilent, where you can find here: [here](https://digilent.com/shop/pmod-ssd-seven-segment-display/).
